# bad-calc
A non functional calculator written in scala and java, plus I have like no expirence in either.


Just clone the repo and then run the makefile. no promises that this works on windows bc I developed it on arch. but it should bc jvm...

## Why it is better than any other calc.
it uses a custom VM, whos stack is a BF tape, the heap is sort of like a SQL table, and to bridge that there is a pointer operation zone thingy.  

Just as a FYI, I wrote this in like a hour and half and the math doesnt work!
